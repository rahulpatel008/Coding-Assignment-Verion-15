## Steps to run (for your environment)

1. Ensure Node `16.13.0` and npm `8.1.0` are installed (you indicated these versions).
2. Create a new Angular project (if starting fresh):

```bash
ng new dynamic-form-renderer --routing=false --style=scss --skip-install
cd dynamic-form-renderer
npm install
```

3. Install any additional packages (none required for basic functionality).
4. Run the app:

```bash
ng serve --open
```

The app will compile using Angular 15 and open in your browser.
